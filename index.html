          <p>
            Born in South Korea, I moved to Canada with my family in middle
            school. Throughout my childhood, I have always been interested in
            the world of computers. In my teenage years, even though I knew
            nothing about programming, I ran a game server and website getting
            spoon-fed by the people on online forums. After graduating high
            school, I started university in General Science, not exactly knowing
            what to pursue. However, after taking a Computer Science course as
            an elective, I instantly knew that this was meant for me. I changed
            my degree program to Computer Science. Then, I had to serve in the
            military for a couple of years as a citizen of South Korea. I
            applied to the Korean Navy and was lucky to be a part of the
            Computer Emergency Response Team. That is basically how my career in
            cybersecurity started. I am always in search of new things. Not just
            in the technology field, I love going through adventures, meeting
            new people, experiencing new cultures, and trying out new foods!
